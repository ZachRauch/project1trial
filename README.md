## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the trends in the movie industry and give reccommendations base on these initial findings to new studios. Exploratory analysis reveals the highest Return On Investment (ROI), runtime averging closer to 2 hours, and Horror-Mystery-Thriller with other genres included produced the greatest ROI. Microsoft can use the analysis made here to have a sense on the type of movies they should aim to make at their new movie studio.

## Business Problem

Microsoft can venture into the movie industry by creating a movie studio under their name. The issue is that Microsoft may be unfamilar with where to begin in the production of new films. With some insight into the landscape of the movie industry such as how much money others are investing per movie, the length of movies and the type of genres that produce high ROI, Microsoft will be able produce films that are profitable. This project decribes the trends in ROI, movie length over time and top genres.

## Data
The data comes from multiple sources. In this project, data from The Movie Database (TMDB), The Numbers (TN) and Internet Movie Database (IMDB) was used. Each data file had the name of the film in which merges occurred on as they each had a column of interest for the analysis. The data provides the production budget, worldwide gross, runtime and other features of a film that are of interest.

## Methods
This project uses descriptive statistics and data analyzation to understand and identify any important trends within the movie industry. 

## Results
### Production Budget
To maximize Microsoft's ROI and minimize potential risk, we found that the ideal production budget is between $5 million and $20 million. Movies within this range tend to have an expected ROI of 300%.

### Run Time
We see that each year that the movie length is getting longer. However, we found that there is no strong relationship between movie length and ROI.

### Genres
The genre with the highest return on investment is Horror-Mystery-Thriller and the second was Horror-Thriller. Based on this information we recommend Microsoft produce Horror-Thriller films.

## Conclusions
Based on our data analysis we would recommend Microsoft:
1- Invest between $5 million and $20 million in Production Budget.
2- Aim for a movie length of about 2 hours.
3- Produce movies in the Horror-Thriller genre.

## Next Steps
Further analysis may prove beneficial in the following areas;
- The relationship between the marketing budget and ROI.
- The impact of well known actors/directors on ROI.
- The ROI on movies with established fanbases, such as books, movies, and videogames.
